A project which gave me experience with creating an application across the whole stack, starting from the database to the user interface.

#### Things I learned:

- Designing a database schema to fit the needs of my application
- Implementing a restful CRUD API via express to flow information to and from the database
- Structuring a larger React project (component structure and composition)
- Use of react hooks
- Harnessing the power of React-Query/s query invalidation
- Simple user authentication flows (if I was to implement authentication for real I would probably just use Auth0)

#### Tech stack:

- typescript
- express
- postgresql (via Slonik and Docker)
- react
- react-hook-form
- react-query
- jsonwebtoken
